# AutoClayBuilder

AutoClayBuilder is a public-safe collection of patterns, scripts, and benchmark notes for rebuilding Clay tables with Clay frontend APIs plus browser automation.

The goal is practical table cloning and table generation:

- extract a source table through Clay's logged-in frontend API
- redact credentials and destination-specific IDs before saving artifacts
- create scratch workbooks and tables without mutating the source
- rebuild fields, views, formulas, extracted fields, action columns, and row seeds
- use browser automation only for UI-only checks and missing API coverage
- score source-to-target config parity from fresh readbacks
- maintain an operational Clay knowledge base for fast GTM workflow builds

This repository intentionally does not include cookies, bearer tokens, API keys, raw table manifests, row data dumps, screenshots with sensitive UI, webhook URLs, Slack IDs, Google Sheet IDs, or Smartlead campaign IDs.

## Quick Start

Use Python 3.11+.

```bash
python3 scripts/redact_clay_manifest.py source-manifest.raw.json source-manifest.redacted.json
python3 scripts/score_clay_parity.py source-manifest.redacted.json target-manifest.redacted.json --field-map field-map.json
```

Try the scorer with fake fixtures:

```bash
python3 scripts/score_clay_parity.py \
  examples/fixtures/source-table.example.json \
  examples/fixtures/target-table.example.json \
  --field-map examples/fixtures/field-map.example.json
```

`field-map.json` should map source field IDs to target field IDs:

```json
{
  "f_source": "f_target"
}
```

## Clone Loop

1. Extract the source table with:

   ```text
   GET /v3/tables/:tableId?extraDataViewId=:viewId&includeExtraData=true
   ```

2. Redact the manifest before writing it to disk.
3. Create a scratch workbook/table. Do not mutate the source table.
4. Recreate fields, field groups, views, and the first 10 seed rows.
5. Fetch the target table through the same API.
6. Score parity from the source and target readbacks.
7. Use browser automation for formula validation, edit drawers, menus, run controls, and representative cell inspection.
8. Run selected fields and sample records only after config looks right.

The first milestone is config parity. Runtime outputs are useful evidence, but they should be logged separately from config parity unless the task explicitly requires output equality.

## Public Repo Safety

Keep live artifacts out of git unless they are deliberately redacted and reviewed. The `.gitignore` blocks common Clay run outputs, auth files, manifests, screenshots, and browser state by default.
